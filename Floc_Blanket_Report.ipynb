        "The purpose of the Floc Blanket Depth team is to test how efficiently particles are being removed, or the efficiency of the floc blanket, at varying floc blanket heights. The experiments will run with floc blanket heights of 25 cm, 50 cm, 100 cm and 200 cm, at an upflow velocity of 2mm/s. The team will be using the bottom geometry designed by the Spring 2019 HRS Bottom Geometry team for all future experiments to further help stabilize the floc blanket.\n",

        "\n",
        "The Floc Blanket Depth team was created to measure the performance of the AguaClara floc blanket to improve sedimentation, a crucial part of the water treatment process as it acts as the major removal method for suspended and coagulated minerals, dirt, and particles. The process of sedimentation occurs when large flocs, which are clumps of particles created by the flocculator, are removed through settling -- the process by which particles settle to the bottom of a liquid. During sedimentation, a floc blanket, or a layer of suspended flocs, was formed and captured other flocs that were too small to settle.\n",
        "\n",
        "Figure 1 below depicts a tube settler used in the current apparatus. Sedimentation occurred in the tube settler. The tube settler used a similar design to an AguaClara plant. The recirculator in the tube settler, a vertical portion of the tube, was where the floc blanket formed and accumulated. The tilted portion at the top of the tube settler acted similar to the plate settlers in the plant by stopping flocs from leaving the tank. The floc weir acted identically to the floc weir in the AguaClara plant by removing excess flocs in the floc blanket to keep it at a constant height.\n",

        "By changing the depth of the floc blanket the team hopes to gain insight into what the appropriate depth of a floc blanket should be in AguaClara facilities.  We expect to find, by varying the depth of the floc blanket, the optimal depth for producing a floc blanket that captures the most impurities in drinking water and reduces the frequency of which the floc sedimentation will need to be cleaned by workers. \n",

        "The Floc Depth team will be testing various floc blanket heights to test the relationship between the floc blanket efficiency in particle removal and floc blanket heights. To find the most optimal height, or depth, of the floc blanket, the team will be focusing and studying on the floc blanket’s stability. By finding the optimal depth, AguaClara will have a set height that they can implement in their water treatment plants to improve sedimentation tanks’ role in the water treatment process.\n",

        "High Rate Sedimentation teams, from previous semesters, designed a bottom geometry that increased floc stability and reduced the clean-up time of the apparatus using an upflow rate of 2mm/s. The Spring 2019 High Rate Sedimentation team designed a bottom geometry for the tube settler to improve the stability of the floc blanket, Figure 2. The bottom geometry of the tube settler included an insert with sloped walls to allow the floc to fall into the upflow, preventing gelling. The most efficient angle for the walls was discovered to lie between 58 and 75 degrees. Future experiments will be conducted using a 58 degree angle on the walls of the inserts for the bottom geometry of the tube settler.\n",
        "\n",

        "Figure 2: Bottom Geometry insert designed by the High Rate Sedimentation Team from the Spring 2019\n",
        "\n",
        "Experiments from the Spring 2019 team ran for a duration of 24 hours. In this period of time, the stability of the floc blanket was analyzed using the effluent turbidity of the system. The floc blanket did not remain stable past, or sometimes within, the 24 hour period due to the gelling of the flocs at the bottom of the tube settler - which was represented by the exponential increase of the effluent turbidity. The hypothesis is that gelling is influenced by the upflow velocity and bottom angle of the test tube.\n",
        "\n",
        "In research conducted by Casey Garland (2015), it was discovered that the overall NTU (turbidity) decreased linearly with an increase in floc blanket height in the early stages, but it would eventually flatten out at a certain height. Thus, there was a need to have a set floc blanket height. However, what was left unclear was the distribution of particles sizes that were being removed from the system. It was hypothesized that the floc blanket is preferentially removing smaller particles and thus that increase in floc blanket height may still be removing small particles, which does not affect NTU readings. A beneficial aspect since it would mean larger floc blankets are still removing these particles, which are usually harder to remove in the filter.\n",

        "##Method\n",
        "---\n",
        "###Calculations\n",
        "####Coagulant Dosing\n",
        "Python coagulant dosing calculations were used to determine the required coagulant pump speed for the desired coagulant dosage. The Summer 2018 High Rate Sedimentation team also determined that a coagulant dose of 4.5 mg/L was optimal to ensure that coagulant was not a limiting factor in the system. This dose corresponded to a pump speed of 6.2 RPM. This code can be found in the [Manual](https://github.com/AguaClara/HRS-Bot-Geo/blob/master/2019%20Spring/Reports/HRSBotGeo2FinalReportDraft.md#Manual) section of this report.\n",
        "\n",
        "####ProCoda Methods\n",
        "PID Control was the state that was used to run experiments. PID Control controlled the clay pump speed to keep the influent turbidity stable at 100 NTU, which is the standardized influent turbidity for the AguaClara High Rate Sedimentation teams. The values of P, i, and D were calibrated using this [guide](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Calibrating+PID+Control).\n",
        "\n",
        "####Flow Rate\n",
        "The flow rate through the system was calculated in accordance with the desired upflow velocity of 2 mm/s and 3 mm/s, as determined by the Summer 2018 High Rate Sedimentation team. The tube settler has an inner diameter of 1 inch, so the following formula\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ dV/dt = pi*(r^2)*dh/dt $$\n",
        "\n",
        "was used to determine the flow rates. A 2 mm/s upflow velocity corresponded to a flow rate of 60 mL/min, and a 3 mm/s upflow velocity corresponded to a flow rate of 90 mL/min.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Experimental Apparatus\n",
        "The overall experimental setup consisted of clay and coagulant reservoirs, three distinct pumps, a flocculator, a tube settler, a pressure attenuator, a pressure inhibitor, and two turbidimeters. The clay stock tank was the clay reservoir and holds a mixture of clay and water. The stirrer continuously mixed the contents of the stock tank. The PaCl coagulant stock tank contained water and PaCl (the coagulant agent) at a concentration of 5 mg/L. The first pump, the water pump, controlled the water flow throughout the system with the flow rate set manually. The second pump, the clay pump, is kept constant and is used to dose clay into the system. The final pump, the coagulant pump, was used to control the coagulant dose and was set manually to dose the optimal coagulant concentration determined by the Summer 2018 High Rate Sedimentation team. While the pressure inhibitor was placed between the incoming water from the water pump and the influent turbidimeter to allow the system to reach a steady state where the flow in equals the flow out.\n",
        " \n",
        "The flocculator was made by winding tubing around a cardboard cylinder. The purpose of the flocculator is to encourage collisions between clay and coagulant particles. Sedimentation occurred in the tube settler, where flocs are recirculated through the settler. Optimal performance of the tube settler involved the formation of a floc blanket, or a suspended fluidized bed of flocs that capture other flocs that are too small to settle. The flocs then flowed down the floc weir, the extension jutting out from the left side of the tube settler. The pressure attenuator indicated whether there pressure was building up in the system; i.e. if water was rising in the attenuator, pressure was building up somewhere, likely due to a closed valve. Lastly, there were two turbidimeters: one that measured influent turbidity and one that measured effluent turbidity. All these components are labeled in Figure 2 below.\n",

        "\n",
        "###Procedure\n",
        "####Cleaning the Apparatus\n",
        "First, the tube settler was drained of any water and clay. Next, the turbidimeters were cleaned as per the instructions in the AguaClara Tutorial Wiki Page. Then water was run through the system at 150 RPM to clean the rest of the system and remove the residual sediment. The flocculator was cleaned by opening the valve between the flocculator and syringe and letting water fill the syringe. When the syringe was filled halfway, the water was forced out, which pushed the residual sediment out of the flocculator. Water continued to run through the system until the influent and effluent turbidimeters read 0 to 1 NTU.\n",
        "\n",
        "####Experimental Procedure\n",
        "At the beginning of an experiment, all valves and connections were checked to ensure desired pathways were clear and undesired pathways were blocked. Next, water and coagulant pumps were set to desired experimental flow rates. The clay stock tank was filled with clay and tap water, and the coagulant stock tank was filled with coagulant and deionized water at the proper concentrations. Next, the clay, coagulant, and waste pumps were turned on. Lastly, ProCoDA was turned on and the state was set to Warmup. During the duration of the experiment, ProCoDA collected data relevant to the experiment, including day fraction, influent turbidity, effluent turbidity, flocculator flow rate, and the speed at which clay was being pumped into the system. The data relevant to measuring the floc blanket's success was the effluent turbidity, and day fraction was converted to time (in hours) since the experiment began.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Results and Analysis\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "A successful experiment in the context of the Floc Blanket team would mean that the floc blanket was stable and there was no buildup of flocs at the bottom of the tube settler, or gelling. Floc blankets formed when flocs continually recirculated and became suspended in the tube settler; the formation of a floc blanket is influenced by the bottom geometry because the geometry determines whether flocs will settle at the bottom. \n",
        "\n",
        "####Baseline Experiment 1\n",
        "A baseline control experiment, at 1 mm/s upflow velocity, was conducted with a printed insert. During the duration of the experiment, the experimental apparatus began to leak due to an increase in pressure in the apparatus. However, the apparatus still experienced gelling regardless of the presence of the printed insert.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Previous High Rate Sedimentation (HRS) subteams have implemented PID Control into their ProCoDa methods. PID Control is the state that was used to run experiments. PID Control controls the clay pump speed to keep the influent turbidity stable at 100 NTU, which is the standardized influent turbidity for the AguaClara High Rate Sedimentation teams. However, due to the new pumps being used in the system, PID was not used in the experiment, so the amount of clay entering the system was kept constant at 40 RPM. This led to too much clay entering the system, thus increasing gelling in the tube settler, as seen in Figure 4 . There were also air bubbles being pumped into the tube settler, due to not having enough clay stock. Having air bubbles is not desirable because they decrease the efficiency of sedimentation, since they cause \"sludge\" to be pushed upwards instead of allowing them to settle. \n",

        "Figure 4: Tube settler experiencing gelling in the weir. No gelling can be seen in the rest of the tube settler due to the leak the tube settler experinced.\n",
        "\n",
        "Figure 5 shows the effluent turbidity remaining constant at ~95 NTU for the first 23 hours, with the exception of two spikes around the 10th and 11th hour. The team believes the spikes were due to air bubbles entering the apparatus from the backwash. They caused some of the floc blanket to break off and leave the tube settler and enter the effluent turbidimeter.\n",
        "\n",
        "After 23rd hour, the effluent turbidity dropped to ~30 NTU and remained constant for the duration of the experiment. It is beleived if the experiment lasted a few more hours, then the floc blanket would have decayed linearly and the graph in Figure 4 would have showed an exponential increase in the effluent turbidity. \n",
        "\n",
        "As the graph shows, the effluent turbidity did not stabilize to the targeted value (10 NTU). The team’s hypothesis is that this is because the amount of clay being pumped into the apparatus was not being controlled. Future experiments will be run using PID control.\n",

        "Figure 5: Effluent turbidiy over time for the first baseline experiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the new pumps, the team has been unable to use the ProCoDa methods files previous HRS teams have developed, so the team created a new methods file from scratch. \n",
        "\n",
        "####Baseline Experiment 2\n",
        "A second baseline experiment was conducted using the same conditions as experiment 1, with the addition of PID control. The team could not use the old values for P, i, and D with the newly-purchased pumps, so the team ran  experiments with new PID values of PID - as shown in the manuel section. \n",
        "As the data in Figure 6 shows, the floc blanket stabilized between 20 and 30 NTU in the first 18 hours. Between the 20th and 33rd hour, there were irregular spikes in effluent turbidity. The team’s hypothesis is that these are due to the PID values not working properly since the influent turbidity never stabilized to 100 NTU, Figure 7. After the 32nd hour, the floc blanket stabilized to 125 NTU; however, this value is too large, so further testing of PID values is needed. \n",

        "\n",
        "####ProCoda File\n",
        "The team has been hindered from running experiments due to the ProCoDa methods file. Like previously mentioned, the team has been working on a new ProCoDa file from scratch. All the pumps are now effectively communicating with the EXCEL spreadsheet and data is being recorded. However, the team's main issue was with PID control since the newly-acquired pumps did not sustain the target influent turbidity of 100 NTU. Consultation with the team Research Advisors (RA’s) and Monroe Weber (AguaClara’s faculty advisor) led to the values of P, i, and D - using a guess-and-check approach. \n",
        "\n",
        "##Conclusions\n",
        "---\n",
        "The Floc Blanket Depth team noticed different results from what was expected. The team believes the entrance of air bubbles into the system was the main reason for this, regardless of the presence of the insert designed by the HRS Bottom Geometry team in past semesters.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, the values used for PID control worked in the first hours of the experiments, but it reached a point in which they did not function anymore.\n",
        "\n",
        "All of this decreased the efficiency of the floc blanket, and thus decreased sedimentation within the system.\n",

        "Future Floc Blanket teams should focus on fixing the values of P, i, and D for PID control to find the optimal values that work with the new pumps. The proper concentration of clay that is being pumped into the system from the clay stock should also be determined to ensure the most precise results from experiments. \n",

When the syringe is halfway filled, push to empty the syringe and to flush water through the flocculator. Repeat until the flocculator is cleared of clay, and close the valve when finished.\n",
